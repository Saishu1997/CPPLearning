/*

Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm is a shortest path algorithm used to find the minimum cost path from a single source node to all other 
nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

It works by:

Assigning an initial distance of 0 to the source node and infinity to all others.
Visiting the node with the smallest known distance and updating the distances of its neighbors.
Repeating this process until all nodes have been visited or the shortest path to the destination is found.
Dijkstra guarantees the shortest path in graphs with non-negative weights and is widely used in network routing and mapping systems.
